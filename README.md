# Stroke-Prediction-Program
A stroke prediciton program with the use of supervised learning algorithm which is Naive Bayes Classifier. The data used by me is a stroke prediction dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset, this data was collected by Federisian. This dataset consists of 5110 patient data, and has features consisting of gender, hypertension, work_type, residence_type, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, bmi, ever_married, smoking_status, stroke. The stroke feature acts as a class, and becomes the target feature for prediction.
